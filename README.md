# pychat
A simple chat in Python with GUI

PYChat is a simple LAN/WAN chat with a TKinter GUI (still learning to make GUIs).
I've tested it on Windows and it fully works, while on Linux the GUI is not that good.
You can see messages sent and received through the console though, so the chat is fully usable.
This project is pretty basic and not really secure, the encryption method is original but pretty basic.
